Adel Bibi is a senior researcher in machine learning and computer vision at the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/adel-bibi/) of the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), a Research Fellow (JRF) at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk), and a member of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Society. Previously, Bibi was a senior research associate and a postdoctoral researcher with [Philip H.S. Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/) since October 2020. He received his MSc and PhD degrees from King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST) in 2016 and 2020, respectively, advised by [Bernard Ghanem](http://bernardghanem.com/). Bibi was awarded an [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/program-updates/fall-2021-and-winter-2022-amazon-research-awards-recipients-announced) in 2022 in the Machine Learning Algorithms and Theory track. Bibi received <span><strong><em>four best paper awards;</em></strong></span> a [NeurIPS23 workshop](/post/prefix_tuning_bes_paper/), an [ICML23 workshop](/post/pinss_paper/), a [2022 CVPR workshop](/post/best_extended_abstract_cvpr22), and one at the [Optimization and Big Data Conference in 2018](/post/big_data_optimization_kaust/). His contributions include over 30 papers published in top machine learning and computer vision conferences. He also received <span><strong><em>four outstanding reviewer awards</em></strong></span> (CVPR18, CVPR19, ICCV19, ICLR22) and a [Notable Area Chair Award in NeurIPS23](/post/notable_ac_neurips23/).

Bibi received an [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/program-updates/fall-2021-and-winter-2022-amazon-research-awards-recipients-announced) in Fall 2021 and has contributed more than 30 papers published in top machine learning and computer vision conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, TPAMI, AAAI, and UAI. Bibi has also served as an Area Chair for NeurIPS23, AAAI23, and IJCAI23. He has received outstanding reviewer awards in CVPR18, CVPR19, ICCV19, and ICLR22.  -->

<!-- Adel works on a variety of machine learninproblems; problems that I personally find interesting and challenging.  -->

Currently, Bibi is leading a group in Oxford focusing on the intersection between AI safety of large foundational models in both vision and language (covering topics such as robustness, certification, alignment, adversarial elicitation, etc.) and the efficient continual update of these models.
