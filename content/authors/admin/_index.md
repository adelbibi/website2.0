I am a senior research fellow in machine learning and computer vision at the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/adel-bibi/) of the University of Oxford with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) led by Prof [Philip Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/). I am also a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) of [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the same group for a year since October 2020. I received my MSc and PhD degrees from [King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) in 2016 and 2020, respectively, where I was part of the [Image and Video Understanding Lab (IVUL)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul) advised by [Bernard Ghanem](http://bernardghanem.com/). In 2018, I was a visiting PhD intern for 6 months at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/research/overview.html) in Munich working with [Vladlen Koltun](http://vladlen.info/). I have worked on a variety of problems; problems that I personally find interesting and challenging. 

Currently, I am interested in large scale offline and online robust continual learning. Robustness, in both aspects empirical and provably certifiable, here refers to deep models under $\ell_p$ bouded additive and geoemtric attacks. Moreover, continual learning refers to the learning from a stream of data in stringent memory and computational settings.
