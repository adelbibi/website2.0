<!-- ## Overview -->

My grant proposal titled "Robust Continual Learning at Scale" was awarded by the KAUST-CRG (KAUST-Competitive Research Grant) fund for a total amount of $1,050,000 USD. This is a joint grant with Philip H.S. Torr (Oxford), Bernard Ghanem (KAUST), Mohamed Elhoseiny (KAUST), and myself in Oxford. This will support my research for the next 3 years ending in summer 2024.
