<!-- ## Overview -->


"I am very excited about this [Systemic AI Safety Grant](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/strengthening-ai-resilience) awarded by the [UK AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/)! I join a number of renowned researchers who have received this award, such as [Philip Torr](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-torr/) and [Michael Bronestien](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/). The award was given to only 20 recipients out of 451 applications (~4% acceptance rate). I will be hiring one postdoc to work on the safety of open-source Agentic AI. I will be working towards this grant along with my co-PIs, [Philip Torr](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/philip-torr/) and [Adam Mahdi](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/adam-mahdi/).
