## Overview

Unfortunately, I did not attend NeurIPS 23 this year as I was ill (luckily, my student Aleksandar Petrov was there to present our paper). However, to my surprise, he sent me this image where I was selected as a notable Area Chair. I had originally received a free conference registration, which this prize now explains. There does not seem to be any other source online, and the only place this information exists is during the opening speech at the conference. With a quick calculation given how many people are on the list and how many Area Chairs there were this year, the acceptance rate was about 8.1% of the total 1223 Area Chairs. I am very grateful as this was my first experience as an Area Chair for NeurIPS.
