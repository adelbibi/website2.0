summary: 
abstract: I present a new view to the output activations of a block of layers in deep neural networks. In particular, we view the output activation of a linear operator, convolutional or fully connected, followed by a non-linearity, and followed by another linear operator as an approximate solution to a certain convex optimization problem. We show that replacing layers with optimization layers as solvers improve performance in different settings.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
